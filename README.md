# EnglishPhoneBook
Phonebook that only displays sections that has names. If you only have Andres in your phonebook only thing shown is: A, Andres. If you add Erick: A, Andres, E, Erick.


I wanted to make a phonebook that could perhaps be used for different languages with different alphabets and such.


Haven't used a map before, turns out they're super cool.
Really don't love what I've done so far, the archicture should be greatly imrpoved but I'll let that rumble in my mind for a bit. I'm happy I did it though. Wanted to work on my recyclerview stuff and ended up learning about sets and collections, dope!
