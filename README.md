Haven't used a map before, turns out they're super cool.
Really don't like what I've done so far, the archicture should be greatly imrpoved but I'll let that rumble in my mind for a bit. I'm happy I did it though. Wanted to work on my recyclerview stuff and ended up learning about sets and collections, dope!
